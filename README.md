# Bank Management System

## Overview
This **Bank Management System** allows users to register, log in, and manage their bank accounts, including making transactions such as sending or depositing money. It provides functionality to track recent transactions, update balances, and perform account-related actions securely. The system is built using C++ with file handling to store user data.

## Features
- **Registration:** Users can create an account by providing their name, age, place of birth, and setting a password.

- **Transaction Management:** Users can send money to other users or deposit money into their account.
- **Balance Tracking:** The system keeps track of the user's balance and ensures that transactions cannot exceed the available balance.
